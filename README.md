# Calculator

Project made based on the video by gustavo nietzki.
This is a basic project, and used basicaly html, css and js. 
In the Js context: 
-Used the DOM concept to manipulate what apears in the "screen" of the calculator. 
-Used functions to implement the buttons of the calc. The functions created are, back() to delete, clean() to delete all that are in the screen, insert() to put the number and simbols in the screen, and finally the calc() function, that makes the magic happens.
In the function calc(), i used the javascript intern function, eval(), to take transform what are in the scren in values to calculate.
